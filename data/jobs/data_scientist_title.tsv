And how do we do this in half a second or less each time. billions of times a day?<br>- Searching on game consoles and other devices using a software keyboard is not easy So how do we delight the user by recognizing what they are searching for with the fewest possible inputs whether it is an actor/director/title/genre/award/film festival search and showing them relevant results from our catalog.<br>- An original title exclusive to Netflix is about to be launched.
