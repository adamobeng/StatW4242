Data Sources
=========

Here are some good places to start looking for data:

* [Research quality datasets](https://bitly.com/bundles/hmason/1) from Hilary Mason at bitly
* [Social science datasets](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/index.jsp) collected by the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research at the University of Michigan


We are collecting the different sources of data that people are exploring here:

* Ariel is hoping to find data about [women's education in STEM fields](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/instructors/ddlgs/guides/genderSTEM/sections). He will also look at the value added model for [teacher performance data](http://garyrubinstein.teachforus.org/2012/02/26/analyzing-released-nyc-value-added-data-part-1/).
* Lily is looking for decent data sources mostly concerning data/data science's place in [pre-college education.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/what-research-really-says-on-teacher-evaluation/2012/09/16/2e9de9fa-ff44-11e1-8adc-499661afe377_blog.html)
